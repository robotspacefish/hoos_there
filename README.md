# Hoo's There?

An Animal Crossing: New Horizons companion app that displays a list of creatures that are available to catch at the current date/time.

### Features
* Filter by creature type or hemisphere
* Sort by name, type, location, shadow size, time available, and price

### Upcoming Features TBA
I wanted to get this live for my own use ASAP so there are currently a few features I didn't get to but I have planned:

* Search
* Updating clock and fetching new creatures when the time changes (ex. if the current time is 4PM and some creatures go away and others appear, it will update to show the correct creatures)
